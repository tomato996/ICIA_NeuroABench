# ICIA_NeuroABench

## 📝 Overview
Our paper introduces **NeuroABench**, a new multimodal benchmark for evaluating anatomical understanding in neurosurgical videos, and finds that while state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show promise, they still fall short of human-level performance in anatomical identification tasks.
